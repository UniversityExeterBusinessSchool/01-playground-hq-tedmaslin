# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]

In my data, there is four green blocks called O which have been evenly spaced out by 2 units called a scattered path

## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]

Well its just four green blocks that have been placed spaced out and next to each other

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]

It could be a garden pathway or something similar? 


## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?]

What all of this means.
